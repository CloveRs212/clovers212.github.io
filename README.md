Code for Kyle DeRusha Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, I am Kyle DeRusha a new web devoloper. This is my first HTML/CSS project for Git. The first stage of the project is to lay out the main design. The first thing focused on in the layout is the navbar, I customized it using floats and input a few list items to go to our first pages inside the portfolio to show off my cases and about me. The navbar is a basic setup with company name on one side of the bar with the page links on the other. There is also a cases button that dispaers once hits 500px so on phones it is not in the way of the design.
