            <div class="about-hello">Hello I am Kyle, I just started my journey into Web Devolopement in 2022.</div>
            <div>I always had some interest with coding from High School, I was playing a game called Minecraft. I began to dabble with programming mods and online servers. I was more focused on a path in the restuant industry so I stopped for a bit and put coding on hold. Once CoviD-19 hit the restuant industry, it was very hard and closed down mostly everything.</div>
            <div>I had to move and restart all over again, with the new beginning in 2020 I tried going to being a barrista as all kitchens were closed down. Then the next summer I tried jumping back into a kitchen at Longhorn, I quickly realized that it wasn't the right path anymore for me. I had many good skills but the joy for it was gone. I made the decison to jump into a warehouse.</div>
            <div>It has been amazing working in the warehouse for L.L. Bean, although one day was thinking of what would I like to do moving foward. As I was playing Minecraft on day I realized that it was a very interesting idea to get back into coding. I quickly started looking up about the industry and decided I had to start all over and grow from there. I could not afford to do a bootcamp or go to school, so I decided that I was going to be self taught. So I did some more research on the best way to do it so I would have the right foundation to go off of.</div>
            <div>I was so thankful that I came accross a person named Anddrie Neagoie, founder Zero To Mastery Academy. As his channel gave me a foundation that I could follow and learn everything related in front end devolopement. The first place I wanted to start in becuase I believe it is a amazing starting point. Which brings me here to today as I type up the code to this Portfolio I am making.</div>
            <div>My journey is just beginning and I am excited to keep updating this project and adding more to it.</div>
